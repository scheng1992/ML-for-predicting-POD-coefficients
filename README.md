# ML-for-predicting-POD-coefficients
In this repository, we develop use two machine learning algorithms (namely DT and KNN) to predict the POD coefficient of a static physical field for the objective of efficient prediction/reconstruction.

The code is written in Python 3, required packages:

#numpy

#scipy

#matplotlib

#time

#sklearn
